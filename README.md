This repository contains all analyses for the manuscript titled "Unraveling the genetic architecture of non-Huntington chorea: A biobank-scale study of rare variants and repeat expansions". This study represents the largest sequencing-based characterization of potentially disease-causing protein-altering variants and short tandem repeat expansions in 190  non-HD chorea cases, leveraging data from the All of Us Research Program dataset (n=134), UK Biobank (n=26), and a Spanish multicenter clinically ascertained cohort (n=30).
